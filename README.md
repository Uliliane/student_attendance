This is a simple Student Management System built with PHP and MySQL. It allows an admin to login securely and perform basic CRUD operations: add, view, edit, and delete student records(especially attendance). All pages are protected using PHP sessions, so only logged-in users can access the system.

To use, place the project in your htdocs folder, create the database and tables, then open login.php in your browser. Use the credentials admin / admin123 to log in, and you can manage the student records from the dashboard.
